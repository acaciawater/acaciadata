refactor bro structures
now bro.MT and bro.GMW have 1:1 relations with meetnet.Screen and meetnet.Well and bro.Request has a GMW FKfield 
the bro models should be directly connected and have a FK relation with meetnet objects. 
This makes it possible to check the BRO history of the meetnet objects

proposal:
MT has FK to GMW (one GMW can have multiple tubes)
MT has FK to meetnet.Screen (one Screen can have multiple bro.tube instances)
GMW has FK to meetnet.Well (one Well can have multiple bro.GMW instances)
GMW has 1:1 to RR (every Request has exactly one GMW and vice versa)

maybe include GMW_Construction SourceDocuemnt??
